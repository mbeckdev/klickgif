# KlickGif

A bunch of CSS animations and the ability to turn them into gifs

Check it out ([Here](https://mbeckdev.github.io/klickgif/))

Here's one of the animations, a confused-cow:

Animations are animal themed for now, maybe someday we'll add other topics (I'm thinking food), but that is not this day!

## Contribute

For anyone who wants to contribute. Everyone's welcome! Need an extra contribution or four to complete that hacktoberfest requirement? Add a new css animation or four. There's also some React that could use some help. See the Contributing guide in the Contributing.md file.

Here's a [discord](https://discord.gg/Tg48qMGF5f) so we can troubleshoot pull requests and stuff.

## Why

There's an article saying gifs are cringe now. I don't think they're cringy, some are just old. So we should make some new ones so we're not always seeing the same 10 year old gifs around.

This will serve as a list of a bunch of new CSS animations that can be exported as gifs eventually (gifs are typically .mp4 files nowadays - I haven't looked too far into how it'll work yet)

I just wanted to accept pull requests for the first time, so hacktoberfest is as good a time as any for me to try it out.

## Status

You can't actually make a gif yet by clicking a button, but that's the plan.

## how to run it locally
