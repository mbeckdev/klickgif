# KlickGif

A bunch of CSS animations and the ability to turn them into gifs

Check it out here (note to self: create github pages link here for a live site)

## Why

There's an article saying gifs are cringe now. I don't think they're cringy, some are just old. So we should make some new ones so we're not always seeing the same 10 year old gifs around.

This will serve as a list of a bunch of new CSS animations that can be exported as gifs eventually (gifs are typically .mp4 files nowadays - I haven't looked too far into how it'll work yet)

I just wanted to accept pull requests for the first time, so hacktoberfest is as good a time as any for me to try it out.

## Contribute

For anyone who wants to contribute. Need an extra contribution or four to complete that hacktoberfest requirement? Add a new css animation or four. There's also some React that could use some help. See the Contributing guide in the Contributing.md file
